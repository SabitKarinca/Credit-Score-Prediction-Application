## Credit Score Prediction Application

This project focuses on predicting an individual's credit score category using various machine learning algorithms.
It includes three main stages: Data Preparation, Model Development, and Interface Design.
The system aims to classify or estimate creditworthiness based on demographic and financial features.

## 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

In the first stage, raw datasets are prepared for machine learning through cleaning, transformation, and merging operations.

### Workflow
- Importing necessary libraries  
- Loading and examining multiple datasets  
- Renaming columns with meaningful identifiers  
- Removing irrelevant or redundant features  
- Merging and restructuring datasets  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Preparing the final dataset for model training  

This stage ensures that the data is consistent, relevant, and optimized for machine learning tasks.

## 2. Machine Learning Model Development

In this stage, multiple classification algorithms are trained and evaluated to predict credit scores accurately.  
Each model’s performance is compared using standard evaluation metrics to determine the most effective one.

### Steps
- Importing machine learning libraries  
- Loading and splitting the dataset  
- Training and validating multiple models  
- Comparing model accuracy and performance  

### Implemented Models
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- XGBoost  
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)  

Each model was assessed using metrics such as **R² Score**, **Accuracy**, and **Precision**.  
The best-performing model was selected and saved for integration into the Tkinter application.

## 3. User Interface Development (Tkinter)

The final stage involves creating an interactive desktop interface using Tkinter.  
The interface allows users to input various personal and financial parameters to receive instant credit score predictions.

### Interface Structure
- Importing GUI and model libraries  
- Integrating the trained models  
- Designing the application layout  
- Implementing input forms for data entry  
- Performing prediction calculations and displaying results  

This stage transforms the machine learning model into an accessible, real-world tool.
